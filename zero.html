Yen Sid's letter gave little in the way of details; such was the nature of old wizards hiding away in their towers, pulling strings in the name of light or dark. Serris folded the paper and slid it into her pocket, securing her katana at her waist before heading for the door. Uncle Carbuncle rested atop her desk, one eye peeping open inquisitively, but she left him behind—something that was becoming more frequent. He managed affairs at the Foundry in her absence, and this time was no exception.

<p>The hangar echoed as the Foundry stirred to life, hinges folding and the air seal preparing to breach. With a touch, the door to her small Gummi ship slid open, and Serris was just stepping inside when a voice halted her progress. 

<p>[i]"Off for milk?"[/i] 

<p>She glanced back to see Jude, leaning against the wall with his signature beret and blonde hair.

 <p>[b]"...I'll be back. Don't worry."[/b] 

<p>[i]"Why?"[/i] Jude pushed himself off the wall, his cane tapping the ground as he hobbled forward. Without his prosthetic, he looked older, wearier. [i]"You've built an elite mercenary group. Why go it alone? Take us with you. There's no sense risking life and limb—pride ain't worth much when you're six feet under."[/i] He stopped a few feet from her, his grizzled face set in a stern frown of disappointment. 

<p>Out of respect for her second-in-command, Serris stepped out of the Gummi ship, turning to face him. [b]"This isn't a contract, there's no money involved. It's personal."[/b] 

<p>She saw him bristle, preparing to argue that they'd follow her to hell if needed, but she cut him off before he could start. [b]"Besides, I'm not going it alone. Back to your post."[/b] She waved him off dismissively. 

<p>[i]"Pulling rank, huh?"[/i] He nodded, resigned. [i]"Alright. Keep your comm handy. I'll keep a ship ready if you call."[/i] As he turned to leave, he muttered under his breath with each step, [i]"Fucking pride. It'll be the death of you yet, and if not you, one of us."[/i] 

<p>Serris sighed heavily, watching him go. Jude understood—he always did—and that’s why it pissed him off. He knew how these things ended. He'd already lived through it all, in a way. 

<p>--- 

<p>After collecting Blue, they departed for San Fransokyo, heading to the coordinates Yen Sid provided. It didn’t take long for chaos to unfold across the streets, and they quickly found themselves in the midst of a violent eruption. Serris rested her hand on the sheathed katana at her waist, fingers trailing the bindings to ensure they were secure as she observed carefully.

 <p>Casualties were unavoidable. She wasn’t here to play the hero. Her mission was simple—cut down whatever was coming and end it. Getting distracted by civilian losses would only compromise her effectiveness. For now, she waited. Her patience paid off when the beings made themselves known. 

<p>[b]"Hmph. Looks like it's showtime."[/b] 

<p>She slapped Blue’s back and began her careful approach toward the mob, eyes locked on the mysterious entities playing as jesters.
